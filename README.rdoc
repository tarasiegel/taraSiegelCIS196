Problems/Comments: Added an HTML file with what is needed for the homework.  I made a form that has inputs for text, radio buttons and check boxs.  Also included links, buttons, images to see if people are my friend. Rails hates me.

Used Jenny's computer for adding to git and heroku.  Was having problems keeping and installing rails.  Will figure that out later.
